    "Abstract_1": "Image denoising is a core problem in image processing. It consists in finding an approximation of a given distorted image that at the same time is more regular than the initial one.",
    "Abstract_2": "From a mathematical perspective, image denoising is a topic deeply investigated from a numerical point of view as well as from an analytical one.",
    "Abstract_3": "The competition between approximation and regularization endows the problem with a natural variational structure, which gave rise to a broad investigation of minimization based denoising models.",
    "Abstract_4": "The main goal of the project is to further develop the analytical study of nonlocal variational image denoising models.",
    "Abstract_5": "For this purpose a range of related nonlocal problems, possibly including the presence of anisotropies, is investigated.",
